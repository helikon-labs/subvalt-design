## SubVT

SubVT (Substrate Validator Toolkit - former Subvalt) is a native mobile application for iOS and Android phones, tablets and wearables that provides node operators with tools that aid them in running their validators on any Substrate-based blockchain network. The app aims to provide through a well-designed UX and UI:

- Configurable notifications about the on- and off-chain events and transactions related to the validators.
- Node monitoring features.
- Validator performance and income reports.

SubVT is proudly supported by the [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) Treasury.
