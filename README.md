[SubVT](https://subvt.io) (Substrate Validator Toolkit) is a native mobile application for iOS and Android phones, tablets and wearables that provides node operators with tools that aid them in running their validators on any Substrate-based blockchain network. The app aims to provide through a well-designed UX and UI:

- Live network status data.
- Active/inactive validator lists, and validator details.
- Configurable push, email, SMS and GSM notifications for on- and off-chain events and extrinsics related to the validators.
- Era reports.
- Validator performance and income reports.

SubVT is proudly supported by the [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) Treasury.
